Hi there!

This document should help clear some things up about how to use the web diagram website

1. File Management
	The files that you open to start the web diagram website must stay together. That being the .HTML, .CSS, and .JS files.
	So the files 830_Web_App.html, 830_Web_App.css, and 830_Web_App.js must all be in the same folder in order to run correctly.
	Additionally, in order to switch between the 830 diagram and the 2200A diagram, the 2200_Web_App.html, 2200A_Web_App.css, and 2200A_Web_App.js must be in the same folder as the 830_Web_App files.
	Saved files can be saved in any folder you choose, but if you want to move the files later, make sure that all three files (.html, .css, and .js) are all moved together

2. How to Make a Line
	To make a line, you need to click on the gray circle you want your line to start at.
	Then the circle will highlight, after which you can click on the next circle you would like the line to connect to. 
	Horray! You made a line!
	The function to create the lines depends on which quadrant (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right) you click on for each circle. 
	So if you want to make lines look extra nice, think about how the material would release off of each roller, and click accordingly.
		a) For example, if I wanted to make a line between 2 circles that are significantly further apart length-wise than height-wise, with the left circle lower than the right circle.
		I would start on the left circle and click on the top-left, then I would click on the right circle on its top-left. 
		Give it a try! Don't be afraid to play around and get used to it.

3. How to Remove a Line
	If you just made a line and want to remove it, you can simply press the "Remove Last" button on the top
	If you want to remove a line without removing the lines or attachments you created after that line, you can use the "Delete Line Mode"
	To access the "Delete Line Mode", press the "DELETE" key on your keyboard. 
	Once the text that says "Click to Delete Line; Press ESC to exit" appears, you can click on the line you would like to remove.
	To exit the "Delete Line Mode", you just have to press the "ESC" key on your keyboard.
	
4. What if There Isn't a Roller There Needs to Be
	If you wish to add a roller that the original drawing of the 830 does not have, you can use the "Click to Make Roller" button on the top row.
	Adding a roller is a two step process with the button.
	First you click on the blue box, then click on the place you would like to add the roller.
	Once the roller is placed you can remove it with the "Remove Last" button.
	Additional rollers work the same any other roller once placed.

5. How to Add Notes
	If you want to add a note or annotation to the web diagram, you can use the "Click to Make Note" button.
	Similar to the "Click to Make Roller" button, you first click on the yellow box, then on the point you want to add a note.
	The textbox that appears can be adjusted in size by dragging the bottom right corner.
	It can also be removed with the "Remove Last" button.

6. How to Mark If a Roller is CW or CCW
	All you have to do is click on the CW or CCW next to the roller tension and a colored overlay with highlight CW or CCW.

7. How to Mark If an In-Feed Nip is On
	Simply click on the In-Feed Nip Box to highlight it
 
8. How to Mark If a Dryer or UV Dryer is on (2200A Only)
	Click on the box where it says Dryer or UV Dryer to highlight it. Doing this will automatically check the checkbox in the accessories below as well.

9. Where are the Dies on the diagram
	In order to make a die show up on the diagram, you need to fill in the "Die#" textbox.
	a) How do I show an undercut? (830 Station 2 Die Only)
		To show an undercut die, type in the die number, then immediately follow "UNDER". 
		*"UNDER" is case-sensitive, so "under" will not work*

10. How to Change Line Color
	If you click on the gray box to the right of the "Choose a color:" text, a color picker will open which you can use to find any color you want.
	Just use the bar slider to find the hue you want, then use the pallete to adjust the brightness.
